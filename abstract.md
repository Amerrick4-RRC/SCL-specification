Abstract
The rapid deployment of large language models (LLMs) across safety‑critical and institutionally governed environments has exposed a structural gap: current systems lack a unified mechanism for governing how models interpret identity, apply rules, adhere to ethical boundaries, and structure their internal reasoning. Existing approaches rely on ad‑hoc prompting, heuristic safety layers, or external wrappers, none of which provide consistent or auditable guarantees.
We introduce the Structured Cognition Layer (SCL), a conceptual governance architecture that operates within the model’s reasoning process to enforce structured, predictable, and aligned behavior. SCL defines three governance domains—Identity Governance, Cognitive Trace Governance, and Ethical Governance—which collectively regulate the model’s role interpretation, reasoning structure, and ethical compliance.
SCL is model‑agnostic and implementation‑agnostic: it specifies what must be governed, not how governance is enforced. By providing a coherent framework for identity stability, rule adherence, principled refusal behavior, and audit‑ready cognitive artifacts, SCL establishes a foundation for governance‑grade oversight of LLM systems. This work positions SCL as a new architectural primitive for the emerging field of LLM governance.
